## Gym

I woke up late around 8 today. So decided to go gym in the evening. Did chest and triceps today along with some shoulder side raises. Felt good overall. I think I'll be back to my previous strength in couple of weeks.

## Activity

Went for a swim from 9pm - 10pm. Swim is usually a 50-min activity if I am booking one slot. It's a guided session by the coach. I've manged to learn some basics along with freestyle swimming with side breathing. It'll take me some time to be smooth while swimming.

We did practice cycling (treading water or simply, swimming at the same spot while keeping head out of the water) today. Apparently, I am really bad at this, gonna take a while to learn this.

I've a [cult.fit](https://cult.fit) subscription for this.

## Learning

Absolutely failed to do this, procrastinated till last and ended up not doing anything. Will make sure I don't end up like this again.

## Work

Usually, I don't work on weekends so took some rest with office work.

## Diet

Diet was overall a lot better than yesterday. Took a calorie surplus balanced diet. Pretty happy with this today.
