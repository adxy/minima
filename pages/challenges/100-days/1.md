## Gym

Went to the gym at 7 in the morning, since I went to gym after a couple of weeks took it lightly and did not push too hard, going to spend 2 more days and then actually track my workouts.

## Activity

I had to go out at 4pm today for some work and came back late night around 11:30pm. Since, I could not have went for a swim/football/run I did a 20-min high-knees session, basically running at the same spot in my room while raising knees high.

My calf hurts in the morning as I am writing this.

## Learning

I am practising DSA, solved 2 medium level questions on Arrays on Leetcode.

## Work

Usual work day, was able to figure out what I need to do to successfully deliver the next feature.

## Diet

Not the best day for diet, but overall managed to stay in calorie surplus. While my body really needs fat I need to work on reducing the fat intake and increase on carbs and fibre.

All the fat sources were healthy, like, peanut butter and milk.
