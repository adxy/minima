Adarsh's portfolio website.

`Built with VanillaJs & CSS without using any fancy libraries.`

## Why?
The current version of website [adxy.dev](https://adxy.dev) was too complicated visually and had too much going on, so I decided to make `Minima` [(beta.adxy.dev)](https://beta.adxy.dev).

## Lighthouse Score
Minima scores a perfect 100 in all fields.

## Build tool
Minima uses [Alvu](https://barelyhuman.github.io/alvu/) to build it's code. 
## Can I use this?
Feel free to fork it and make it your own!
